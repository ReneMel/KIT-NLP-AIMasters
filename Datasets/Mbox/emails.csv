Enhanced account security is coming,"
------------------------------
We're kicking security up a notch.
------------------------------

Account Number: XXXXXXX042
Account Type: Individual

Dear Jose, 

We're always working to make your Capital One InvestingSM online account as secure as we can. Soon, we'll be adding enhanced online security-and we want you to know what to expect.

What's new.
Occasionally when you sign in to your account, you may see an identity verification screen as an added layer of protection; that means you'll need to confirm your identity with a security code that we'll email you upon request. Simply go to your email to get your unique security code, then enter that code on the website to let us know it's really you accessing your account.

Why.
This enhanced, two-factor authentication will help protect you against fraud, unauthorized account access and identity theft. Check out our FAQs(https://www.capitaloneinvesting.com/main/help/topic.aspx?FaqCode=OTP01) to learn more.

What you can do.
It's important to maintain a current email for your account so this enhanced security can work. If this isn't the best email address for you, sign in(https://www.capitaloneinvesting.com) to your account and make sure your contact information is up-to-date.

Sincerely,  
The Capital One Investing Team

Phishing Email Corpus,"Good Morning, Jose,

 

My name is Michael Kotson, and I am a Cybersecurity researcher at MIT
Lincoln Laboratory.  I am developing a lecture for an internal class on
phishing and social engineering for Lincoln staff, and I am hoping to
include a machine learning-based exercise to illustrate the differences
between detecting phishing attacks and run-of-the-mill spam.

 

If your Phishing Corpus from 2007 is still available, would you mind if I
used it for this class?  Or do you have suggestions for other datasets that
might suit our needs?

 

Thank you very much for your time, and I hope you have a wonderful day.

 

Regards,

 

Michael

  	   Dear Customer
 
 Welcome to the movement towards a cleaner, greener, paperless world.
 
 Attached to this email is your encrypted electronic statement with enhanced security. To open it simply follow the step-by-step instructions below.
 
 Also, please advise us if your email address changes  that way we can ensure that you receive your eStatement safely, on time, every time.

  	 	 
  	 	 
  	 
   
  	  
   
  	 	 
  	 
  	 
  	   By opting for eStatements, youre making a tangible contribution to shrink your, and Nedbanks, carbon footprint. As South Africas green bank, and to show our commitment to a cleaner, greener world, Nedbank will donate 25c to The Green Trust for every eStatement we send.  	 
    Its the small things we do together that add up to make a big difference in curbing climate change.  	 	 
   	 
  	 	 	 
  	 
   
  	  
   
  	   Opening your
encrypted statement  	 	 
   
  	 	   
To open your statement you will need Adobe Reader version 5 or higher.
 Click here to download.

  	 	 
  	 	  
  Step 1:	   Double-click on the attachment.  	 
  	 
  Step 2:	   Type in your password.  	 
  	 
  Step 3:	   Click 'OK'.  	 
  	 
  	 	 
  	 	   This message has been digitally signed to enable you to verify both its origin and integrity. If the message has been tampered with in any way, a security warning will alert you when you open the mail. To verify the senders digital identity simply click on the
 red ribbon.  	 	 
  	 	  	 	 
  	 
  	 
  	 	  
  	   Your Password  	 
  	 	   
Your password is your account number. To help you avoid confusion if you have multiple current accounts, simply look at the name of the attachment in the email  the last four digits are the same as the last four digits in your account number. However, please be sure that you use your full account number when typing in your password(s).

  	 	 	 
  	 
  	 
  	   Statement Cycle  	 
  	 	   
Nedbank will email your statement in accordance with your chosen statement cycle (eg monthly). If we encounter a problem delivering your eStatement  eg mailbox is full  we will continue trying for up to 24 hours. Thereafter the email will be deemed undeliverable.
 
 If your statements remain undelivered for three consecutive cycles, Nedbank will cease to send you eStatements. To resume the service, simply contact Nedbank on 0860 555 111 and ensure that your eStatements delivery details are up to date.

  	 	 	 
  	 
  	 
  	 	 
  	 
   
  	  
 
  	   For more information or if you need assistance with your eStatement call 0860 555 111 between 07:30 and 18:00 Monday to Friday and 7:30 and 13:00 on Saturdays.

 If your statements remain undelivered for three consecutive cycles, Nedbank will cease to send you eStatements. To resume the service, simply contact Nedbank on 0860 555 111 and ensure that your eStatements delivery details are up to date.

  	   Dear Customer
 
 Welcome to the movement towards a cleaner, greener, paperless world.
 
 Attached to this email is your encrypted electronic statement with enhanced security. To open it simply follow the step-by-step instructions below.
 
 Also, please advise us if your email address changes  that way we can ensure that you receive your eStatement safely, on time, every time.

  	 	 
  	 	 
  	 
   
  	  
   
  	 	 
  	 
  	 
  	   By opting for eStatements, youre making a tangible contribution to shrink your, and Nedbanks, carbon footprint. As South Africas green bank, and to show our commitment to a cleaner, greener world, Nedbank will donate 25c to The Green Trust for every eStatement we send.  	 
    Its the small things we do together that add up to make a big difference in curbing climate change.  	 	 
   	 
  	 	 	 
  	 
   
  	  
   
  	   Opening your
encrypted statement  	 	 
   
  	 	   
To open your statement you will need Adobe Reader version 5 or higher.

  Step 1:	   Double-click on the attachment.  	 
  	 
  Step 2:	   Type in your password.

  	   Your Password  	 
  	 	   
Your password is your account number. To help you avoid confusion if you have multiple current accounts, simply look at the name of the attachment in the email  the last four digits are the same as the last four digits in your account number. However, please be sure that you use your full account number when typing in your password(s).

  	 	 	 
  	 
  	 
  	   Statement Cycle

 Phishing is the attempt to obtain personal information online and is one of the most common forms of internet fraud. If you have an email account, you've probably been on the receiving end of a phishing email at one stage or another. These emails are usually very believable and if you do give personal information to phishers, they can use it for financial gain or identity theft.

 Welcome to the movement towards a cleaner, greener, paperless world.
 
 Attached to this email is your encrypted electronic statement with enhanced security. To open it simply follow the step-by-step instructions below.
 
 Also, please advise us if your email address changes  that way we can ensure that you receive your eStatement safely, on time, every time.

  
 
 
 
	 
 
 	 
  Five years ago we committed to contribute 25c per electronic statement to The Green Trust 
on behalf of our clients who opted to receive their statements electronically. Please note 
that this donation will come to a close on 31 December 2017. Thank you for your continued support in preserving our environment. 
  
 
 
 
	 
 
	  Opening your
encrypted statement  
 
		  
To open your statement you will need Adobe Reader version 5 or higher.
 Click here to download.

  
		 
Step 1:	  Double-click on the attachment.  
Step 2:	  Type in your password.  
Step 3:	  Click 'OK'.  
 
		  This message has been digitally signed to enable you to verify both its origin and integrity. If the message has been tampered with in any way, a security warning will alert you when you open the mail. To verify the senders digital identity simply click on the
 red ribbon.  
		 
 
 		 
	  Your Password  
		  
Your password is your account number.

However, please be sure that you use your full account number when typing in your password(s).

  
	  Statement Cycle  
		  
Nedbank will email your statement in accordance with your chosen statement cycle (eg monthly). If we encounter a problem delivering your eStatement  eg mailbox is full  we will continue trying for up to 24 hours. Thereafter the email will be deemed undeliverable.
 
 If your statements remain undelivered for three consecutive cycles, Nedbank will cease to send you eStatements. To resume the service, simply contact Nedbank on 0860 116 400 and ensure that your eStatements delivery details are up to date.

There won’t be any astronauts on board. But today’s launch is a crucial test that marks the start of NASA’s eagerly awaited new lunar program. Now — specifically, at 8:33 am ET — it’s time for blast off.

But ultimately this is all about preparing to bring humans back to the moon as soon as 2025...for the first time since 1972.

On Friday, the Department of Justice released a heavily redacted 32-page affidavit. It’s the document the FBI used to get a warrant to search former President Donald Trump’s home in August. The affidavit confirms that secret documents were recovered from Mar-a-Lago earlier in the year. Reminder: back in January, Trump’s team returned 15 boxes of government documents to the National Archives after taking them home from the White House. The affidavit says those included 184 documents labeled as “secret,” “confidential,“ or “top secret.” And contained info about “clandestine human sources“ (think: spies or informants) that could have been dangerous in the wrong hands. Fast forward to August: the FBI went back to Trump’s residence with their warrant,&nbsp;and found 11 additional sets of classified documents. The DOJ hasn’t commented beyond the release of the affidavit, but in June it said the documents hadn’t been “handled in an appropriate manner.“ Trump’s spokesperson says that there was no reason for a search and that it’s “all politics.”&nbsp;</p><hr style=""height: 1px; border: none; background-color: #D1DAD9; margin: 24px 0;""><p style=""font-family: 'Graphik', sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 28px; margin: 0;""><b>Who’s saying ‘I did it first’…</b></p><p style=""font-family: 'Graphik', sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 28px; margin: 0; margin-top: 16px;""><a href=""https://link.theskimm.com/click/28878462.5204274/aHR0cHM6Ly9za2ltbXRoLmlzLzNRVkJPd1I/61eeb5a16c24457224441b5fB49bc3530"" style=""color: #008280; text-decoration: underline #008280 solid; text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-thickness: 1px; text-underline-offset: 4px; text-decoration-color: #008280;"">Moderna</a>. Last week, the Massachusetts-based company sued Pfizer and the German drugmaker BioNTech for patent infringement. Moderna says that Pfizer and BioNTech hit copy and paste on its mRNA tech for their COVID-19 vaccine. Moderna claims it filed the patents way back between 2010 and 2016. The company pledged not to enforce its patent when the pandemic was in full force. And it says it isn’t trying to get Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines off the market now. But it wants companies to respect its intellectual property and request proper permission to use its work. Both Pfizer and BioNTech responded that their work is original, and say they’ll defend themselves in court.</p><p style=""font-family: 'Graphik', sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 28px; margin: 0; margin-top: 16px;"">…Oh and speaking of vaccines, the Biden admin is expected to have <a href=""https://link.theskimm.com/click/28878462.5204274/aHR0cHM6Ly9za2ltbXRoLmlzLzNkWmZjMDI/61eeb5a16c24457224441b5fB7400ae7e"" style=""color: #008280; text-decoration: underline #008280 solid; text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-thickness: 1px; text-underline-offset: 4px; text-decoration-color: #008280;"">Omicron-specific boosters</a> ready around the week after Labor Day.</p><hr style=""height: 1px; border: none; background-color: #D1DAD9; margin: 24px 0;""><p style=""font-family: 'Graphik', sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 28px; margin: 0;""><b>What’s got parents talking…</b></p><p style=""font-family: 'Graphik', sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 28px; margin: 0; margin-top: 16px;""><a href=""https://link.theskimm.com/click/28878462.5204274/aHR0cHM6Ly9za2ltbXRoLmlzLzNRNTJDZGE/61eeb5a16c24457224441b5fB890b9780"" style=""color: #008280; text-decoration: underline #008280 solid; text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-thickness: 1px; text-underline-offset: 4px; text-decoration-color: #008280;"">Missouri</a>. This summer, Cassville R-IV School District in western MO gave the ‘OK’ to bring back spanking. The district told parents that it would start swatting students with paddles as a punishment for misbehavior. Kids would only be spanked if their parents give written permission — with a choice to opt out later. The district also claims it will only swat kids as a last resort and that it will not be done in front of their peers. Other rules: two workers must be present (the spanker and a witness) and they cannot hit students in the head or face. The measure is a school board response to a survey sent to parents, students, and staff, which found that parents were worried about student behavior. Many states have outlawed corporal punishment in schools — but Missouri is one of 19 that still allow it.</p><hr style=""height: 1px; border: none; background-color: #D1DAD9; margin: 24px 0;""><p style=""font-family: 'Graphik', sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 28px; margin: 0;""><b>Who’s GOAT us in our feels…</b></p><p style=""font-family: 'Graphik', sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 28px; margin: 0; margin-top: 16px;""><a href=""https://link.theskimm.com/click/28878462.5204274/aHR0cHM6Ly9za2ltbXRoLmlzLzNDRWVIVGU/61eeb5a16c24457224441b5fBe079f4eb"" style=""color: #008280; text-decoration: underline #008280 solid; text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-thickness: 1px; text-underline-offset: 4px; text-decoration-color: #008280;"">Serena Williams</a>.

In November 1958 the then-Federal Aviation Agency, now Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), took over operations of the AMB. The lease transferred to the FAA and was sold for $55,000. Atlantic City decided to retain 84 of the 4,312 acres. The FAA expanded the former U.S. Navy land parcel to about 5,000 acres (20 km2) and established the National Aviation Facilities Experimental Center research facility that eventually became the William J. Hughes Technical Center. The South Jersey Transportation Authority (SJTA) initially leased portions of the airport from the FAA and now serves as the airport owner and operator of the facility.\n\nWhen the Navy departed in 1958, the 119th Fighter Squadron of the New Jersey Air National Guard relocated to Atlantic City from their former base at Newark International Airport with their F-84F Thunderstreak aircraft, establishing an Air National Guard base on the site of the former naval air station. The current 177th Fighter Wing of the New Jersey Air National Guard has been at this location ever since.\n\nDuring the 1960s and early 1970s, the active duty U.S. Air Force's 95th Fighter Interceptor Squadron, stationed at Dover AFB, Delaware, maintained an Operating Location and Alert Detachment of F-106 Delta Darts at Atlantic City ANGB on 24-hour alert. After the 177th Fighter Wing reequipped with the F-106 in 1973, the 177th took on the air defence alert mission.\n\nIn the fall of 1983, American International Airways attempted to operate a small hub at the airport with Douglas DC-9-30 jetliners with passenger service to Boston, Buffalo, Chicago, Cleveland, Detroit, Fort Lauderdale, Miami, Orlando, Pittsburgh, Tampa and West Palm Beach. ACY has also had US Airways jet service to Pittsburgh as well as US Airways Express turboprops to Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington, and Continental Express turboprops and regional jets\n"""

The bones showed that the bird was a heron, first named Ardea megacephala in 1873, but moved to the night heron genus Nycticorax in 1879 after more remains were described. The specific name megacephala is Greek for ""great-headed"". Two related extinct species from the other Mascarene islands have also been identified from accounts and remains: the Mauritius night heron and the R\xc3\xa9union night heron.\n\nThe Rodrigues night heron was robust, its bill was comparatively large, stout and straight, and its legs were short and strong. It is estimated to have been 60 cm (24 in) long, and its appearance in life is uncertain. There was marked sexual dimorphism, males being larger. Little is known about its behaviour, but the contemporary accounts indicate that it ate lizards (probably the Rodrigues day gecko), was adapted to running, and although able to fly, rarely did so. Examinations of the known remains have confirmed its terrestrial adaptations; one researcher thought the species flightless but this idea hThe French traveler Francois Leguat mentioned ""bitterns"" in his 1708 memoir A New Voyage to the East Indies about his stay on the Mascarene island of Rodrigues from 1691\xe2\x80\x9393. Leguat was the leader of a group of nine French Huguenot refugees who settled on Rodrigues after they were marooned there. Leguat\'s observations on the local fauna are considered some of the first cohesive accoun\n ts of animal behaviour in the wild. In 1873, the French zoologist Alphonse Milne-Edwards described subfossil bird bones from Rodrigues he had received via the British ornithologist Alfred Newton. These had been excavated in 1865 under the supervision of his brother, Colonial Secretary Edward Newton, by the police magistrate George Jenner, who found the specimens in a cave on the Plaine Corail, near Rodrigues solitaire remains.\n\nMilne-Edwards correlated the bones with the ""b\n'"

King Stephen I ascended the throne in 1000, converting his realm to a Christian kingdom. The medieval Kingdom of Hungary was a regional power, reaching its cultural and political height in the 15th century. Following the Battle of Moh\xc3\xa1cs in 1526, the Kingdom of Hungary was partially occupied by the Ottoman Empire until the Treaty of Passarowitz in 1718. Hungary came under Habsburg rule at the turn of the 18th century, later joining with the Austrian Empire to form Austria-Hungary in 1867, a major power into the early 20th century.\n\nAustria-Hungary collapsed after World War I, and the subsequent Treaty of Trianon established Hungary's current borders, resulting in the loss of 71% of its territory, 58% of its population, and 32% of ethnic Hungarians. Following the tumultuous interwar period, Hungary joined the Axis powers in World War II, suffering significant damage and casualties. Postwar Hungary became a satellite state of the Soviet Union, leading to the establishment of the Hungarian People's Republic. Following the failed 1956 revolution, Hungary became a comparatively freer, though still repressed, member of the Eastern Bloc. The removal of Hungary's border fence with\n"""

Santos said working on the show helped ""hone her skills in these two fields"" and proved that she ""can also do something aside from acting"". She was later cast in Topel Lee\'s horror thriller Ouija (2007) alongside Jolina Magdangal, Iza Calzado, and Rhian Ramos. The film was met with mixed reviews; Philip Cu-Unjieng of The Philippine Star wrote, ""There is nothing earth-shaking in the treatment of the material or the performances he  elicits from the ensemble."" Jocelyn Dimaculangan, however, noted Santos\'s ""restrained performance"". Her final appearance that year was in the comedy drama Sakal, Sakali, Saklolo, the sequel to Kasal, Kasali, Kasalo. The response from critics was overwhelmingly negative; the Philippine Daily Inquirer\'s Nestor Torre Jr. dismissed the film for its ""thrice-told plots and exhausted stellar performances"", while Asilo \n stated that it ""meanders into a list of issues that eventually clutter up its exposition and focus"". Despite poor critical reception, the film grossed ?122 million (US$2.3 million) at the box office.\n\n2008\xe2\x80\x932013: Established actress\nSantos co-produced and starred in the independent drama Ploning (2008), which was the Philippine submission for Best Foreign Language Film at the 81st Academy Awards. Jimenez-David wrote that her performance showed ""maturity and ripeness, a depth of character that hints at a life lived fully and well"", and described the film as ""moving, dazzling, and yet intimate and comforting"". Santos said she considered taking the part as a ""start of a new chapter"" in her career. The film was screened at the Palm Springs International Film Festival, Newport Beach Film Festival, and Christopher B. Smith Rafael Film Center in the United States. Santos\'s next role in 2008 was in Jun Lana\'s psychological horror thriller Mag-ingat Ka Sa... Kulam as a woman who questions her own sanity after a car accident leaves her with amnesia. Critic Karen Caliwara commended Santos\'s ""versatility"" and considered her to be the film\'s prime asset. In 2009, Santos worked with Agoncillo and Javier Reyes for the third ti\n me in the sitcom George and Cecil, which explored a reversal of gender\n'"
