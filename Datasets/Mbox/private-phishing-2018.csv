eBay Deutschland Customer Support <spoof@ebay.de>,Jose Nazario <jose@monkey.org>,"Sat, 19 Jan 2008 10:15:35 -0700",RE: IV%ORC055 - Ihr Hinweis an eBay Sicherheit.  (KMM6148859V34796L0KM),"Guten Tag,

vielen Dank fuer Ihre Nachricht. Sie haben eine E-Mail erhalten, von der
Sie sich nicht sicher sind, ob sie von eBay verschickt wurde.

Die E-Mail wurde ueberprueft und dabei hat sich ergeben, dass diese 
nicht von eBay verschickt wurde. Es handelt sich um eine gefaelschte 
E-Mail, eine sogenannte Spoof-E-Mail.

Was sind Spoof-E-Mails?

Gefaelschte E-Mails (Spoof-E-Mails) stammen nur scheinbar von eBay und 
enthalten in der Regel einen Link, über den Sie zu einer gefaelschten 
Website gelangen. Dort werden Sie dann gebeten, sich einzuloggen und 
persoenliche Daten und Mitgliedsdaten einzugeben.

Was koennen Sie tun?

Wir empfehlen Ihnen, die E-Mail aus Sicherheitsgruenden sofort zu 
loeschen. Auf keinen Fall sollten Sie auf die E-Mail antworten oder auf 
einen Link oder eine Schaltflaeche der E-Mail klicken oder einen 
Dateianhang oeffnen.

Wenn Sie moeglicherweise schon persoenliche Daten auf einer gefaelschten
Webseite eingegeben haben, empfehlen wir Ihnen, sofort Ihr Passwort zu 
aendern. Lesen Sie zudem unter folgendem Link, welche Schutzmaßnahmen 
Ihnen für Ihr Mitgliedskonto zur Verfuegung stehen:

http://pages.ebay.de/help/tp/isgw-account-theft-reporting.html

Wie erkennen Sie, ob eine E-Mail von eBay verschickt wurde?

Ueberpruefen Sie in Mein eBay, ob dort unter ""Meine Nachrichten"" eine 
kopie der E-Mail abgelegt wurde. Sollte das nicht der Fall sein, leiten 
Sie die E-Mail an spoof@ebay.de weiter.

Warum ist es sehr wichtig, dass Sie Ihren Computer und Ihr 
Betriebssystem vor Viren schuetzen?

Moeglicherweise befinden sich auf Ihrem Computer Viren oder Trojaner, 
die von der Person verbreitet wurden, die Ihnen die gefaelschte E-Mail 
geschickt hat. Trojaner ermoeglichen den Zugriff auf Informationen, die 
auf Ihrem Computer gespeichert sind. Computerviren koennen 
beispielsweise Tastenanschlaege protokollieren. Manchmal ist es gar 
nicht notwendig einen eventuell vorhandenen Dateianhang zu oeffnen. Es 
gibt auch Viren und Trojander, die sich unbemerkt auf Ihrem Computer 
installieren koenne.
 
Wir raten Ihnen daher dringend, auf allen Computern, von denen aus Sie 
auf eBay zugreifen, die Sicherheitseinstellungen zu ueberpruefen und 
gegebenenfalls zu aktualisieren. Sie sollten ausserdem eine Firewall und
eine Virenschutzsoftware installieren und regelmaessig aktualisieren. 
Wenn Sie eine verdaechtige E-Mail erhalten haben, empfehlen wir Ihnen, 
Ihren Computer auf Viren und Trojaner zu ueberpruefen.

Ueberpruefen Sie bitte auch, ob es aktuelle Updates fuer Ihr 
Betriebssystem und Ihr E-Mail-Programm gibt. Sollten Sie Ihre E-Mails 
extern (z. B. ueber Web.de, GMX, Hotmail oder Yahoo) abrufen, 
informieren Sie sich bitte auf den jeweiligen Internetseiten ueber den 
Schutz vor Viren.

Was unternimmt eBay gegen Spoof?

Wir nehmen die Bedrohung durch Spoof und Phishing sehr ernst. eBay und 
PayPal arbeiten eng mit Internetprovidern und Strafverfolgungsbehoerden 
zusammen, um die betreffenden Seiten zu schliessen und die 
Verantwortlichen zur Rechenschaft zu ziehen.

eBay hat zusammen mit mehreren Behoerden und Unternehmen die Initiative 
""Deutschland sicher im Netz"" gegruendet, zu finden unter:

https://www.sicher-im-netz.de

Antworten Sie bitte nicht auf diese E-Mail. Sie wurde automatisch 
versendet, um Ihnen so schnell wie moeglich zu antworten.

Bei Fragen zu anderen Themen sollten Sie als Erstes unsere Hilfeseiten 
zu Rate ziehen:

http://pages.ebay.de/help/index.html 

Wenn Sie dort keine Antworten auf Ihre Fragen finden, koennen Sie unser 
Kontaktformular nutzen: 

http://pages.ebay.de/kontakt

Fuer viele Themen bieten wir zusaetzlich telefonische Unterstuetzung an:

http://pages.ebay.de/telefon

Wir moechten Ihnen ausdruecklich fuer Ihre Unterstuetzung danken und 
wuenschen Ihnen weiterhin viel Spass und Erfolg bei eBay.

Schuetzen Sie sich vor betruegerischen Websites. Die kostenlose eBay 
Toolbar mit Sicherheits-Check hilft Ihnen dabei, sich vor der Eingabe 
vertraulicher Daten auf betruegerischen Websites zu schuetzen. Sie 
finden die Toolbar unter:
